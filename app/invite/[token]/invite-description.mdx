Another birthday, another inappropriately close party announcement. ðŸ˜…

Anyway, this time you will also have the delightful opportunity to disappoint,
by participating in an unhinged powerpoint karaoke. ðŸ˜ˆ

Each presentation will be 3min (hard limit) and there is no theme for the
presentation other than you should try to ~~destroy~~ mess with who ever will be
presenting your powerpoint.

The PowerPoint karaoke is optional, and will **start at 22:00**.

Other than that, it will be chill hang with friends, happy to see you. âœ¨ðŸŽ‚
