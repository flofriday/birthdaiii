      <div className="pb-6">
        <h2 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">What is this thing?</h2>
        <p>It's a simple website I wrote to manage the invites for my birthday party.</p>
      </div>


      <div className="pb-6">
        <h2 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Did you really build this just for a birthday?</h2>
        <p>Sure.</p>
      </div>

      <div className="pb-6">
        <h2 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Couldn't you just have used a normal spreadsheet or not written it down at all, like the cool kids</h2>
        <p>Yes.</p>
      </div>

      <div className="pb-6">
        <h2 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">So why did you built it?</h2>
        <p>
          Partly, because I can and partly because for my last time I wrote
          a scientific paper as an invitation so this time I needed to up my
          game, cause the competition is fierce!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="pb-6">
        <h2 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Oh damn who else does stuff like that?</h2>
        <p>
          No, it's just me for now.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="pb-6">
        <h2 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Can I share my invite link?</h2>
        <p>
          Please don't, each invitee got their own custom invite link. If your friends didn't get one and you want to bring them you can just add them as plus one.
          <br />
          Of course you can share the location, date etc with the people you bring.
        </p>
